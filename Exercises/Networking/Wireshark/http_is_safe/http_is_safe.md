Author: PizzamanJ10

## Intro
In this exercise you'll see exactly why we moved from http to https :)

## Exercise
In the included pcap, you'll find a session of a computer, `192.168.176.70`, signing in to `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/`. Your job is to find the password that was used to sign in!

## Solution
Enter what you think the answer is on `https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/` to get an MD5hash.
If it's `036a9b3ce99db5aa3528121b67473d00`, you're correct!!!

Good luck!
