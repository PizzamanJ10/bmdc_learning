# Nmap - Network Mapper

One of those times when I was wandering around the internet I found this very [strange website](http://scanme.nmap.org/).                
Can you help me scan it?

I want to see what ports are open, show me only open ports?

Now lets try to understand what services are beind served on these ports?

Are there firewalls in this site??
