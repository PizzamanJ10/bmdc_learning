## Python Topics up to and Including Making UDP Calls

## 1. Python Basics

- Data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Variables and assignment
- Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical
- Control flow: if, elif, else
- Loops: for, while
- Functions: defining, calling, parameters, return values
- List comprehensions
- Lambda functions
- Exception handling: try, except, finally

## 2. File Handling

- Opening, reading, writing, and closing files (open, with statements)
- Modes of file operations: r, w, a, b
- Working with binary files

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and objects
- **init** method (constructors)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Class and static methods
- Magic methods (**str**, **repr**, **len**, etc.)

## 4. Modules and Packages

- Importing modules: import, from ... import
- Creating and using your own modules
- Virtual environments and venv
- pip for installing external packages

## 5. Data Structures and Algorithms

- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets

## 6. Built-in Libraries

- math, random, datetime, os, sys
- Command-line arguments with sys.argv
- Environment variables with os.environ

## 7. Regular Expressions

- Using the re module
- Basic patterns and search methods (match, search, findall)
- Substitutions and groups

## 8. Networking

- Introduction to networking concepts (IP, ports, protocols like TCP and UDP)
- Using the socket module

## 9. Making TCP Calls

- Understanding client-server architecture
- Creating a TCP socket server and client using socket
- Binding, listening, and accepting connections (server-side)
- Connecting to a server (client-side)
- Sending and receiving data using send, recv

## 10. Making UDP Calls

- Difference between TCP and UDP
- Creating UDP socket using socket.SOCK_DGRAM
- Sending and receiving data using UDP (sendto, recvfrom)
- Handling non-reliable and unordered data delivery

## 11. Concurrency (Optional for Networking)
