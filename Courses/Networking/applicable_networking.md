# Applicable Networking
Author: PizzamanJ10

## Intro
Welcome to the applicable networking course!
In this course you will get to know networking at a very high level, and also learn how to write scripts and programs that will allow you to use your networking knowledge practically. 

## Table of Contents
In this course we will cover the following:
1. The networking OSI model (or 5 layer model)
2. Useful tools
	1. Wireshark
	2. Nmap
	3. Ncat
3. Using browser dev tools in networking
4. Some Python networking libraries
	1. requests
	2. scapy

Let's get started!

### 1. The OSI Model
For learning about the OSI model, start with the learning material at [here](/Learning_Material/Networking/OSI_Model.md).
There are exercises in the book it brings, make sure to do them. 

### 2.1 Wireshark
You should now have some basic knowledge in wireshark, from the previous lesson.
To get more familiar with it, solve the exercises [here](/Exercises/Networking/Wireshark).

### 2.2 Nmap
To start with Nmap, start with the learning material [here](/Learning_Material/Networking/Nmap.md).

Then solve the exercise #TODO.

### 2.3 Ncat
Ncat is an extremely useful tool for sending/recieving information in an easy way in a network.
Start with the learning material #TODO.

Then solve the exercises #TODO

### 3. Dev tools
#TODO

### 4.1 Requests
To learn about requests, read the material [here](/Learning_Material/Python/requests.md).

For exercises, solve the 2 exercises [here](/Exercises/Python/Requests.md).

### 4.2 Scapy
Scapy, in my opionion, is one of the most useful libraries in Python for networking. 
Use the learning material [here](/Learning_Material/Python/scapy.md).

For the exercises, we made **a lot** of exercises for you to solve.
This is because they also help summarize a lot of networking topics. 
You can find the exercises [here](/Exercises/Python/Scapy).


## Summary
Hopefully you enjoyed the course, at this point you shoud have a very good understanding of networks, and how you can take advantage of them. 
Good luck!!
