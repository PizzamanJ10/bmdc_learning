# The OSI model 
Author: Daniel Chait

## Intro
The OSI model is the first basic thing any person learning networking needs to know.
It is the model on which all networking today is based.

## Source
I personally recommend, especially if hebrew is your mother tongue, to learn from the following source: https://data.cyber.org.il/networks/networks.pdf.
It is a wonderful book, written by the Israeli Cyber Education Center. 

For learning about the OSI model, read the intro, and then learn chapters 1,3, and 4 extremely well. Do all the exercises there too. 

Good luck!!!
