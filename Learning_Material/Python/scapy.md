# Python Scapy library 
Author: PizzamanJ10

## Intro
Scapy is a wonderful library, for creating, sending, sniffing, and manipulating packets. 
It gives you lots of flexibility, allowing you to build and send any kind of packet, even ones that you maybe aren't supposed to send :)

## Source
I personally recommend, especially if hebrew is your mother tongue, to learn from the following source: https://data.cyber.org.il/networks/networks.pdf.
It is a wonderful book, written by the Israeli Cyber Education Center. 

For learning about scapy, learn chapter 5 extremely well. Do all the exercises there too. 

Good luck!!!
